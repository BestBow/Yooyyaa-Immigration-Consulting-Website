# Yooyyaa Immigration Consulting Website

This project is a fully structured and responsive website designed for **Yooyyaa Immigration Consulting Services**, a company that provides professional immigration guidance. The site was built to establish the client's digital presence and help clients access relevant services and information in an organized, user-friendly format.

## Overview

Designed and developed this website using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). The site includes:

- A dynamic homepage
- Detailed service pages (study permits, work visas, sponsorships, permanent residency)
- An FAQ section
- About Us and Contact Us pages
- Legal compliance pages (Privacy Policy and Terms of Service)
- Mobile responsiveness
- Basic admin panel framework
- SEO optimization

---

## Features

- **High-Fidelity UI**: Built based on carefully designed wireframes for responsiveness and accessibility.
- **Admin Panel (in progress)**: Admin landing page developed; login & content editing features partially implemented.
- **SEO Optimization**: Meta tags and accessibility best practices integrated.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully optimized for mobile and desktop.
- **Form Submission Setup**: Contact form connected via email API (Gmail App Passwords used for security).
